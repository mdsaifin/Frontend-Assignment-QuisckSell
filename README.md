As part of the Frontend Assignment, I have developed an interactive Kanban board using React JS. The project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, manage dynamic state, and create a responsive, visually appealing user interface.

In this solution, I focused on implementing the core features of grouping and sorting tickets based on status, user, and priority, while ensuring that the user experience remains consistent across page reloads. I adhered strictly to the guidelines by using pure CSS for styling and avoided any external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of React state management and CSS while delivering a functional, real-world application.
